# Applicant Tracking System

Developed By : Mark Anthony Castllo



This system was designed and created for the Human Resource division of Athios as a part of my internship. The product is seperated into two components: HR and applicants.


## Applicants
The Applicant side was created to be a catalog with the available positions listed on the site. From there, candidates can select and apply for any position as well as check the status of previous applications. Users can upload resumes, and enter various information such as previous work expereince, education, and other materials to our database.
