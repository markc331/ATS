# Applicant Tracking System

Developed By : Mark Anthony Castllo



This system was designed and created for the Human Resource division of Athios as a part of my internship. The product is seperated into two components: HR and applicants.

## HR 
> The HR side was created to have user login sequence in order to maximize applicant confidentiality. Through this portion of the system, Human Resources can create an unlimitied number of positions, which will be stored on a server. HR would also have the ability to look through the various positions open within their company, and view the applicants. HR would have access to the full applicant database which has sensitive information regarding prospective candidates.


## Applicants
> The Applicant side was created to be a catalog with the available positions listed on the site. From there, candidates can select and apply for any position as well as check the status of previous applications. Users can upload resumes, and enter various information such as previous work expereince, education, and other materials to our database.
